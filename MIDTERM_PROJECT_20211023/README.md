### Objective
I want to create a model that can predict if the assessed customer is bad or good based on several parameters described below. 
The dataset used for training was taken from https://www.openml.org/d/31 and I use two different methods for this as comparison, 
using unsupervised (autosklearn) and supervised (decision trees). Because of interpretability consideration, 
I decided to choose the decision trees as the final model. 
This is my first time to create the machine learning from end to end besides previous homeworks and lessons, 
so I am certain that there are so many flaws on my analysis and methods. Need input from this. Thank you.
